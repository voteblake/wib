short: Plans, motivations, and expectations.

You've likely found your way here on my request. This space (however ugly) will be one for me to document the many transitions I'm making in the coming months, and to keep tabs on my future activities. Transitions to consider in the short term are:

* A move from the United States to Ireland
* Learning a new city, roughly double in size
* Changing from a security generalist to a pure engineering role
* Entering E-Commerce from the Industrial space
* Leaving friends and family many time zones behind

On the home page you'll be able to keep track of my recent physical location. My nerdy friends can view the details of how I'm pulling that off on [this site's GitHub repo.](https://github.com/voteblake/wib/blob/master/app/blog/views.py) This will be as recent as my last social-media check in. Over time you will also get the opportunity to interact with me through comments on the public messages.

Expect more soon on the minutiae of the move, my next two weeks are going to be logistics heavy.
