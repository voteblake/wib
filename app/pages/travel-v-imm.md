short: Making the distinction and finding the right neighborhood.

Preparing for the move to Ireland has meant a lot of research. At least that is how I tend to cope with impending change. Most articles I come across are meant for people on holidays - where to stay, what to do, how to get around. While some articles have been useful, these questions have different meanings for people looking at only a brief stay.

Neighborhoods
-------------

Many of my criteria are like those of tourists. I need a safe neighborhood that is easy to get around from. Other large influences on my quality of life may not be relevant - and don't get must treatment in travel guides. Proximity (and quality) of shopping for food and housewares, for example, are largely irrelevant to them.

Tourist guides mention getting around in relation to access to the city center and main transit points like the [Bus√°ras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus%C3%A1ras) and [Connolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Connolly_railway_station). Also, the Dublin Bus system is undecipherable while still abroad. They somehow get away with not having a system map online. This means choosing a flat that has easy access to not just the locations mentioned above, but also the office, means lots of manual runs of [HitTheRoad](http://hittheroad.ed) maps.

City residents reports mixed bike friendliness on Dublin's roadways. Since I plan on participating in the [Cycle-to-Work scheme](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/cycle_to_work_scheme.html), availability of bike lanes or light traffic roadways becomes an important feature as well. This too seems like something I will have to test post-arrival.

Online Communities
------------------

Since travel guides have provided mixed value, I instead set out looking for communities of Dubliners and expats online. These folks have been intensely helpful, both in the existing archive of discussion and in response to my specific questions. [A quick post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dublin/comments/20d9kd/moving_to_dublin_neighborhood_recommendations/) I made on reddit generated about 20 responses, all with local insight in to Dublin neighborhoods. On reddit [/r/dublin](http://reddit.com/r/dublin), [/r/ireland](http://reddit.com/r/ireland) and [/r/iwantout](http://reddit.com/r/iwantout) (an expat community) have been helpful - so has the Ireland-specific discussion board [Boards.ie](http://boards.ie).
